SSL has the right to impose reasonable conditions and to request a reasonable fee before providing such information. Any information supplied by SSL or obtained by you, as permitted hereunder, may only be used by you for the purpose described herein and may not be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software which is substantially similar to the expression of the Software.

3. PRE-RELEASE AND EVALUATION PRODUCT ADDITIONAL TERMS
If the product you have received with this license is pre-commercial release or beta Software (“Pre-release Software”), then this Section applies. In addition, this section applies to all evaluation and/or demonstration copies of SSL software (“Evaluation Software”) and continues in effect until you purchase a license. To the extent that any provision in this section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this Software License Agreement, this section shall supersede such other term(s) and condition(s) with respect to the Pre-release and/or Evaluation Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. You acknowledge that the Pre-release Software is a pre-release version, does not represent final product from SSL, and may contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss.
CONSEQUENTLY, THE PRE-RELEASE AND/OR EVALUATION SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU “AS-IS” WITH NO WARRANTIES FOR USE OR PERFORMANCE, AND SSL DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WHERE LEGALLY LIABILITY CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE AND/OR EVALUATION SOFTWARE, BUT IT MAY BE LIMITED, SSL’S LIABILITY AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SUM OF FIFTY DOLLARS (USD $50) IN TOTAL.
If the Evaluation Software has a time-out feature, then the software will cease operation after the conclusion of the designated evaluation period. Upon such expiration date, your license will expire unless otherwise extended. Access to any files created with the Evaluation Software is entirely at your risk. You acknowledge that SSL has not promised or guaranteed to you that Pre-release Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, that SSL has no express or implied obligation to you to announce or introduce the Pre-release Software, and that SSL may not introduce a product similar to or compatible with the Pre-release Software. Accordingly, you acknowledge that any research or development that you perform regarding the Pre-release Software or any product associated with the Pre-release Software is done entirely at your own risk. During the term of this Software License Agreement, if requested by SSL, you will provide feedback to SSL regarding testing and use of the Pre-release Software, including error or bug reports. If you have been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, your use of the Software is governed by such agreement. You may not sublicense, lease, loan, rent, distribute or otherwise transfer the Pre-release Software. Upon receipt of a later unreleased version of the Pre-release Software or release by SSL of a publicly released commercial version of the Software, whether as a stand-alone product or as part of a larger product, you agree to return or destroy all earlier Pre-release Software received from SSL and to abide by the terms of the license agreement for any such later versions of the Pre-release Software.
4. LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
(a) Limited Warranty and Customer Remedies. SSL warrants to the person or entity that first purchases a license for use of the Software pursuant to the terms of this Software License Agreement that (i) the Software will perform substantially in accordance with any accompanying Documentation for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt, and (ii) any support services provided by SSL shall be substantially as described in Section 5 of this agreement. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you. To the extent allowed by applicable law, implied warranties on the Software, if any, are limited to ninety (90) days. SSL and its suppliers’ entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at SSL’s option, either (i) return of the price paid, if any, or (ii) repair or replacement of the Software that does not meet SSL’s Limited Warranty and which is returned to SSL with a copy of your receipt. This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, abnormal use, Trojan horse, virus, or any other malicious external code. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. This limited warranty does not apply to Evaluation and/or Pre-release Software.
(b) No Other Warranties and Disclaimer. THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY AND REMEDIES STATE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR SSL OR ITS SUPPLIER’S BREACH OF WARRANTY. SSL AND ITS SUPPLIERS DO NOT AND CANNOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS YOU MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE SOFTWARE. EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY, AND FOR ANY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR TERM TO THE EXTENT WHICH THE SAME CANNOT OR MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY LAW APPLICABLE TO YOU IN YOUR JURISDICTION, SSL AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS OR TERMS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE AS TO ANY OTHER MATTERS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SSL AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OR ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.
(c) Limitation Of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE, IN NO EVENT SHALL SSL OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES, EVEN IF SSL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, SSL’S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT.
Because some states and jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not apply to you. In such states and jurisdictions, SSL’s liability shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law and the limitations or exclusions of warranties and liability contained herein do not prejudice applicable statutory consumer rights of person acquiring goods otherwise than in the course of business. The disclaimer and limited liability above are fundamental to this Software License Agreement between SSL and you.
(d) Infringement Claims. SSL will indemnify and hold you harmless and will defend or settle any claim, suit or proceeding brought against you by a third party that is based upon a claim that the content contained in the Software infringes a copyright or violates an intellectual or proprietary right protected by United States or European Union law (“Claim”), but only to the extent the Claim arises directly out of the use of the Software and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement as expressly provided. You must notify SSL in writing of any Claim within ten (10) business days after you first receive notice of the Claim, and you shall provide to SSL at no cost with such assistance and cooperation as SSL may reasonably request from time to time in connection with the defence of the Claim. SSL shall have sole control over any Claim (including, without limitation, the selection of counsel and the right to settle on your behalf on any terms SSL deems desirable in the sole exercise of its discretion). You may, at your sole cost, retain separate counsel and participate in the defence or settlement negotiations. SSL shall pay actual damages, costs, and attorney fees awarded against you (or payable by you pursuant to a settlement agreement) in connection with a Claim to the extent such direct damages and costs are not reimbursed to you by insurance or a third party, to an aggregate maximum equal to the purchase price of the Software. If the Software or its use becomes the subject of a Claim or its use is enjoined, or if in the opinion of SSL’s legal counsel the Software is likely to become the subject of a Claim, SSL shall attempt to resolve the Claim by using commercially reasonable efforts to modify the Software or obtain a license to continue using the Software. If in the opinion of SSL’s legal counsel the Claim, the injunction or potential Claim cannot be resolved through reasonable modification or licensing, SSL, at its own election, may terminate this Software License Agreement without penalty, and will refund to you on a pro rata basis any fees paid in advance by you to SSL. THE FOREGOING CONSTITUTES SSL’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT. This indemnity does not apply to infringements that would not be such, except for customer-supplied elements.
5. SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE
SSL offers multiple optional “Support & Maintenance Package(s)” (“SMP”) for the version of Software product edition that you have licensed, which you may elect to purchase in addition to your Software license. The Support Period, hereinafter defined, covered by such SMP shall be delineated at such time as you elect to purchase a SMP. Your rights with respect to support and maintenance as well as your upgrade eligibility depend on your decision to purchase SMP and the level of SMP that you have purchased:
(a) If you have not purchased SMP, you will receive the Software AS IS and will not receive any maintenance releases or updates. However, SSL, at its option and in its sole discretion on a case by case basis, may decide to offer maintenance releases to you as a courtesy, but these maintenance releases will not include any new features in excess of the feature set at the time of your purchase of the Software. In addition, SSL will provide free technical support to you for thirty (30) days after the date of your purchase (the “Support Period” for the purposes of this paragraph a), and SSL, in its sole discretion on a case by case basis, may also provide free courtesy technical support during your thirty (30)-day evaluation period. Technical support is provided via a Web-based support form only, and there is no guaranteed response time.
(b) If you have purchased SMP, then solely for the duration of its delineated Support Period, you are eligible to receive the version of the Software edition that you have licensed and all maintenance releases and updates for that edition that are released during your Support Period. For the duration of your SMP’s Support Period, you will also be eligible to receive upgrades to the comparable edition of the next version of the Software that succeeds the Software edition that you have licensed for applicable upgrades released during your Support Period. The specific upgrade edition that you are eligible to receive based on your Support Period is further detailed in the SMP that you have purchased. Software that is introduced as separate product is not included in SMP. Maintenance releases, updates and upgrades may or may not include additional features. In addition, SSL will provide Priority Technical Support to you for the duration of the Support Period. Priority Technical Support is provided via a Web-based support form only, and SSL will make commercially reasonable efforts to respond via e-mail to all requests within forty-eight (48) hours during SSL’s business hours (MO-FR, 8am GMT – 5pm GMT, UK holidays excluded) and to make reasonable efforts to provide work-arounds to errors reported in the Software.
During the Support Period you may also report any Software problem or error to SSL. If SSL determines that a reported reproducible material error in the Software exists and significantly impairs the usability and utility of the Software, SSL agrees to use reasonable commercial efforts to correct or provide a usable work-around solution in an upcoming maintenance release or update, which is made available at certain times at SSL’s sole discretion.
If SSL, in its discretion, requests written verification of an error or malfunction discovered by you or requests supporting example files that exhibit the Software problem, you shall promptly provide such verification or files, by email, telecopy, or overnight mail, setting forth in reasonable detail the respects in which the Software fails to perform. You shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate in diagnosis or study of errors. SSL may include error corrections in maintenance releases, updates, or new major releases of the Software. SSL is not obligated to fix errors that are immaterial. Immaterial errors are those that do not significantly impact use of the Software. Whether or not you have purchased the Support & Maintenance Package, technical support only covers issues or questions resulting directly out of the operation of the Software and SSL will not provide you with generic consultation, assistance, or advice under any circumstances.
Updating Software may require the updating of software not covered by this Software License Agreement before installation. Updates of the operating system and application software not specifically covered by this Software License Agreement are your responsibility and will not be provided by SSL under this Software License Agreement. SSL’s obligations under this Section 6 are contingent upon your proper use of the Software and your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Software License Agreement at all times. SSL shall be under no obligation to provide the above technical support if, in SSL’s opinion, the Software has failed due to the following conditions: (i) damage caused by the relocation of the software to another location or CPU; (ii) alterations, modifications or attempts to change the Software without SSL’s written approval; (iii) causes external to the Software, such as natural disasters, the failure or fluctuation of electrical power, or computer equipment failure; (iv) your failure to maintain the Software at SSL’s specified release level; or (v) use of the Software with other software without SSL’s prior written approval. It will be your sole responsibility to: (i) comply with all SSL-specified operating and troubleshooting procedures and then notify SSL immediately of Software malfunction and provide SSL with complete information thereof; (ii) provide for the security of your confidential information; (iii) establish and maintain backup systems and procedures necessary to reconstruct lost or altered files, data or programs.
6. SOFTWARE ACTIVATION, UPDATES AND LICENSE METERING
(a) License Metering. Some SSL software has a built-in license metering module that helps you to avoid any unintentional violation of this Software License Agreement. SSL may use your internal network for license metering between installed versions of the Software.
(b) Software Activation. SSL’s Software may use your internal network and Internet connection for the purpose of transmitting license-related data at the time of installation, registration or update to an SSL-operated license server and validating the authenticity of the license-related data in order to protect SSL against unlicensed or illegal use of the Software and to improve customer service. Activation is based on the exchange of license related data between your computer and the SSL license server. You agree that SSL may use these measures and you agree to follow any applicable requirements.
By your acceptance of the terms of this Software License Agreement or use of the Software, you authorize the collection, use and disclosure of information collected by SSL for the purposes provided for in this Software License Agreement. European, United States, Canadian and South African users understand and consent to the processing of personal information in the United Kingdom for the purposes described herein. SSL has the right in its sole discretion to amend this provision of the Software License Agreement at any time. You are encouraged to review the terms of Software License Agreement as posted on the SSL Web site from time to time.
7. TERM AND TERMINATION
This Software License Agreement may be terminated (a) by your giving SSL written notice of termination; or (b) by SSL, at its option, giving you written notice of termination if you commit a breach of this Software License Agreement and fail to cure such breach within ten (10) days after notice from SSL. In addition the Software License Agreement governing your use of a previous version that you have upgraded or updated of the Software is terminated upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Software License Agreement accompanying such upgrade or update. Upon any termination of the Software License Agreement, you must cease all use of the Software that it governs, destroy all copies then in your possession or control and take such other actions as SSL may reasonably request to ensure that no copies of the Software remain in your possession or control. The terms and conditions set forth in Sections 1(g) 2, 4(b), (c), 8, and 9 survive termination as applicable.
